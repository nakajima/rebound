h1. rebound

By default, instances of UnboundMethod can only be bound to objects that
are a kind_of? the method's original class. Pretty lame.

rebound allows unbound methods (instances of UnboundMethod class) to be
bound to objects of any class. It uses the alias_method_chain pattern to
accomplish this, meaning you also get a bind_without_indifference method
that retains the original behavior.
